_The Scribus Newsletter_

This a new try at publishing a Scribus Newsletter. In the last month, I've been taking notes online about
what has happened in the Scribus community.

15.10 - 12.11.2012

- Franz has added a timer showing the time remaining until the next autosave. It has been made opt-in.

- Some work by Franz on the tables:
  - disabling the shape tab of the PP.
  - resizing the cells when the table size changes.

- Craig moved the internal language definition to use language codes instead of language names.

- Cezary's footnotes have been being committed to the trunk.

- Ale and Manuel are working on a "Scribus Planet", a feed aggregator collecting posts about Scribus.

- Ale and Silvia are leading the translation sprint into Italian for the Scribus free manual (http://graficalibera.org/attivita/).

- Franz has added the support for annotations and form elements when loading PDFs
