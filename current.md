_The Scribus Newsletter_

This a new try at publishing a Scribus Newsletter.

During the last month, I've been taking some notes about what has happened in the Scribus community.
For now it's a very irregular publication (depending mostly on when I have time for it) but it would be
wonderful if it get to a weekly or biweely rythm. And it would be even better if it would not depend
on me having time for it!

If you want to participate, the easiest way is to fork https://github.com/aoloe/scribus-newsletter
and make pull requests to get your contributions into the next issue!<br>
If github is an unknown world for you, don't worry, get in touch with me and we will find a way
to introduce you to github or we will look for other ways to get your contributions in!

What I most need:

- People with good writing skills, who can put a bit more of glamour around the naked facts.
 
- ... some help in collecting facts...

- People creating screenshots, sceencasts, and sample documents showing the new features.

I hope that you'll enjoy the short read!
