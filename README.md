### Skills

What we most need:

- People with good writing skills, who can put a bit more of glamour around the naked facts.
- ... some help in collecting facts...
- People creating screenshots, sceencasts, and sample documents showing the new features.

### How to contribute

Issues are discussed and prepared in the issue tracker on Github:

https://github.com/aoloe/scribus-newsletter/issues

There will be one ticket for each issue of the newsletter.

You can add your contributions in there or learn how to use Github to edit and push the files.

Since it's not possible to upload files to the issue tracker -- if you're not cloning the repository locally -- you will have to make the files available in some other way on the net and link them from the the specific ticket.

### How to use Github

- Go to <http://github.com>.
- If you don't have an account click on the green link "Sign up for free" and create an account.
- Go to https://github.com/aoloe/scribus-newsletter/ and for fork the repository  
  ![fork button](https://github.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/bootcamp_3_fork.jpg)
- You can now browse through the files which are now in your repository, open the markdown file in the current edition and edit it by clicking on the edit button:  
  ![edit button](https://a248.e.akamai.net/camo.github.com/911659f61e808a2f1d477e06ba8e356a7982d951/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736b697463682e636f6d2f32303131303831352d6266726d6479663874746a3261696939377862373731323439352e706e67)
- Once you have finished editing the file, just make a "pull request" (there is a button for it), which
  will notify me that there I need to integrate your contribution into the Newsletter

Of course, if you know about git and github, after having forked the repository,  you can edit your files locally and then make a pull request.
